# GPA-Calculator
This is a console application that models a Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator. It prompts the user to provide details about the name, code, unit and score for a course. It takes in these details as input and grades the score dynamically; a score between 70-100 is assigned A and graded 5 quality points, a score between 60-69 is assigned B and graded 4 quality points, a score between 50-59 is assigned C and graded 3 quality points, a score between 45-49 is assigned D and graded 2quality points, a score 40-44 is assigned E and graded 1 quality point , while 0-39 is assigned F and graded 0. The process then uses this to calculate the Grade Point Average and prints the result onto the console.
